Beyond this, the ECB will also work with Microsoft to explore how ball-tracking technology can help to unearth the next generation of elite cricketers, and provide more opportunities for diverse talent across the whole game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At cricket’s grassroots, digital skills training will be delivered to people across local cricketing communities as part of Microsoft’s “Get On 2021” campaign.

    "\n",
    "According to research, nearly 80% of employers believe graduates do not arrive fully equipped with the skills they need to be work ready. LinkedIn data shows that members with a Microsoft Professional Certification on their profile are 2.4X more likely to be hired.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has had a long running commitment to digital upskilling in the region. “Greater Manchester’s digital sector is thriving, with record levels of investment in 2022,” he explains. “Ensuring everyone in the city region can benefit from the opportunities this investment creates is crucial to securing Greater Manchester’s position as a world leading digital city region.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "“This partnership with Microsoft will support 30,000 local people to develop the digital skills and confidence they need to pursue digital opportunities. By matching the resources of industry partners with our local schools and colleges we can ensure real local benefits,” Mayor Burnham says. “Collaboration between the public sector, industry and academia is at the heart of our vision for Greater Manchester to become an integrated technical skill city region and is just one example of how we are doing digital differently to deliver the priorities of our Digital Blueprint.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Get on Greater Manchester and the GMCA’s Digital Blueprint, there’s a lot to celebrate. But for Greater Manchester, the excitement continues. As announced in the Chancellor’s Spring Budget, the county is one of 12 investment zones across the UK which will benefit from £80m to invest in skills, infrastructure, tax relief and business rates reduction. And more than that – GMCA will receive new powers to control its local funding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Marie Hamilton, Greater Manchester Region Lead for Microsoft, has worked closely with GMCA in developing the Get on Greater Manchester plan. “As the fastest growing tech hub in Europe it’s an exciting time to be in Greater Manchester, this MOU formalises and strengthens our relationship with GMCA,” she says. “Together we will shine a spotlight on the opportunities available within the tech sector, encouraging higher take up of digital careers, improve diversity, and empower more people to benefit from the region’s growth.” \n",
